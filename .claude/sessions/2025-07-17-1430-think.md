**Major Issues Resolved**:
1. **ASOPRO CSV Detection**: Fixed filename detection to recognize "Catalogo*" files as ASOPRO
2. **Column Parsing**: Fixed CSV parsing to handle column names with leading spaces
3. **Price Comparison Logic**: Inverted logic so higher prices win (for billing purposes)
4. **Barcode Pattern**: Fixed regex pattern to work without word boundaries

**Key Features Implemented**:
1. **Price Rounding Function**: `round_price_up()` rounds to next multiple of 100
2. **Simplified Interface**: Reduced from 5 to 4 columns, one row per product
3. **Smart Price Selection**: Automatically selects highest price between drugstores
4. **Automatic Suggestions**: Shows rounded price ready for billing

**Technical Changes**:
- Added `math` import for ceiling function
- Completely rewrote `compare_drugstore_results()` method
- Updated GUI column definitions and headers
- Simplified color tag system (3 tags instead of 6)
- Modified export functions for new column structure
- Updated status bar to show simplified statistics

**Test Results**: Aspirinetas example now correctly shows ASOPRO ($810.00) as winner over DEL SUD ($801.50), with suggested price of $900.

**Critical Issues Resolved**:
1. **Table Column Misalignment**: Replaced pack-based layout with precise grid system using fixed column widths
2. **Unprofessional Design**: Implemented modern table structure with proper header-data alignment
3. **Outdated Edit Icon**: Replaced "‚úèÔ∏è" with modern "üñäÔ∏è" pen icon with blue styling
